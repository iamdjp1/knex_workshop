UNIT: Champions and allies

Class Bonus: A Class Bonus card effect is only applied if your champion's class matches that card's class. The class of a card is always the first listed subtype. There are 8 classes in Grand Archive: Assassin, Cleric, Guardian, Mage, Ranger, Tamer, Warrior, and Spirit (sometimes). Be careful with activating cards while your champion is a level 0 spirit because you likely won't have any Class Bonus effects enabled.
